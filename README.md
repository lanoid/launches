# Launcher
A small application to display launch data from `launchlibrary.net`, created in just over five hours, with help from my react-bootstrap project.

## Setup

`npm i`

## Run

`npm run dev`

Parcel will attempt to run the project on http://localhost:1234

## Test

`npm test`

### Considerations

With more time, I would liked to have:

- Styled the output far more nicely - improved responsiveness
- Ensured that the table data is represented fully accessibly
- Broken out react Fragments
- Refactoring where possible
- Strengthened all tests
- Spent time removing unnecessary modules/libs
