# Launcher
A small application to display launch data from `launchlibrary.net`, created in just over five hours, with help from my [react-typescript-jest](https://github.com/lanoid/react-typescript-jest) project.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0dd6589c-44ab-4bd9-8308-1628300fdd64/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/inspiring-brattain-31eb28/deploys)

[Deployed Version](https://lanoid-launches.netlify.com)

*Really sorry about how it looks, ran out of time to do more sass*

## Setup

`npm i`

## Run

`npm run dev`

Parcel will attempt to run the project on http://localhost:1234

## Test

`npm test`

### Considerations

With more time, I would liked to have:

- Styled the output far more nicely - improved responsiveness
- Ensured that the table data is represented fully accessibly
- Broken out react Fragments
- Refactoring where possible
- Strengthened all tests
- Spent time removing unnecessary modules/libs
- Added definitions where needed instead of <any>
